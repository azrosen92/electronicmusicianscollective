About Exact WordPress Theme

Exact is a clean WordPress theme that is highly customised - you can specify your own custom header and custom background - or simply use one of the images provided.  The theme also supports custom menus and sidebar widgets.

The image displayed for each post is set by specifying a "featured image".  Edit the post in question, and then select an image under where it says "Featured image".  This image will automatically be created as the correct dimensions - however if you want to make it the right dimensions before uploading it, then they are 240 pixels by 240 pixels.  Once you've selected a featured image, save the post, and the image will appear on the website.

The theme has been extensively tested in a variety of browsers, and is all valid XHTML.  Please note the header menu only shows one level of menu items, and does not currently feature a drop down to show submenu items.

This theme is totally free to use - for personal sites, paid sites, commercial use etc - the header and background images supplied are adapted from photos originally taken by myself - so there are no copyright issues.  You can modify both the theme and images however you want.

For your references:

Header images are 966px wide by 140px high
Featured images are 240px wide by 240px high
Background images can be any size
The overall width of the content area for each page/post is 666px.

Sidebar Widget - so you can customise your sidebar
Custom Header Menu - so you can add custom menu options at the top of the page
Custom Backgrounds

Hope you like the theme - Hannah :)
